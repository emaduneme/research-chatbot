# AI Code Editor Prompt for Chat UI with n8n Integration

Please create a minimalist chat interface that integrates with n8n webhooks, following the design principles of Apple, Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, and Dieter Rams. 

## Design Guidelines

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The layout should be clean and uncluttered, with intuitive navigation and minimal visual distractions. Every design element should serve a purpose.

2. **High-Quality Aesthetic**: Use a refined color palette with neutral, calming tones and subtle accent colors. Avoid dark blue unless absolutely necessary. The design should utilize white space effectively and feature clear, modern typography.

3. **Function Over Form**: All design choices should prioritize usability and function. Use visual hierarchy to guide users toward important information.

4. **Precision in Details**: Pay close attention to spacing, typography, and interactions. Every element should feel cohesive and polished.

5. **Human-Centered Design**: Create a seamless, responsive design optimized for all devices, especially mobile.

6. **Visual Effects**: Incorporate glassmorphism and subtle blur effects where appropriate to enhance the UI.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Setup**: Create a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

2. **Chat UI Components**:
   - Header with a title (e.g., "Climate Change Solutions")
   - Message bubbles with different styling for user and bot messages
   - Message input field with send button
   - Loading indicator for when the bot is "thinking"

3. **n8n Integration**:
   - Configure the app to send messages to an n8n webhook
   - Parse and display responses from the n8n webhook
   - Handle any errors gracefully

4. **Code Structure**:
   - Modular components
   - Clean, readable code
   - Mobile-first approach

## Project Structure Reference

- `/app`: Next.js app directory
- `/components`: UI components
- `/config`: Configuration file for the webhook URL
- `/docs`: Documentation for n8n integration

## Implementation Rules

1. **No Changes Without Permission**: Never make changes to the codebase without explicit permission from the project owner.
2. **Simplicity First**: Always prioritize simplicity and elegance in the code.
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Implement features one at a time, ensuring each works perfectly before moving on.
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation clear and up-to-date for all implemented features.

Follow these guidelines to create an elegant, minimalist chat interface that exemplifies the principles of great design.
